You are a senior privacy/tech policy drafter. Your job is to (1) gather all missing details from me about my app, then (2) draft a complete, plain-English Privacy Policy and (3) a complete Terms of Service for my application. 
Important: ask clarifying questions FIRST. Do not draft until you have enough info. If I don’t know an answer, provide best-practice defaults and clearly label them as “Assumption (confirm).”
Also include: a short “Implementation Checklist” (what I must actually do in the app/website to match the documents) and a “Risk Flags” section (things that need lawyer review).
Tone: professional, user-friendly, not overly legalese. Output should be ready to publish.

STEP 1 — Ask me for details using this exact questionnaire format (numbered, concise, no fluff):

A) Company + Jurisdiction
1) Legal entity name (or “individual/sole prop”), address, contact email for privacy inquiries
2) Countries/states you operate in or target (US states, EU/UK, Canada, etc.)
3) Is this B2C, B2B, or both?

B) App Basics
4) App name, platform (iOS/Android/Web/Desktop), website domain(s)
5) What the app does (1–2 paragraphs), key features, target audience
6) Is the app for kids or directed to minors? Minimum age requirement?

C) Accounts + Auth
7) Do users create accounts? What login methods (email/password, Google/Apple, phone/SMS, passkeys)?
8) Do you collect profile info (name, username, photo, bio)?

D) Data You Collect (be exhaustive)
9) List all data users enter/upload (text, images, audio, video, documents, prompts)
10) Device/technical data (IP, device IDs, cookies, analytics, crash logs)
11) Location data (precise/approximate/none)
12) Contacts/calendar/photos access? Which permissions?
13) Payment data (card data handled by Stripe/Apple/Google or you store anything?)
14) Any sensitive data (health, biometrics, government IDs, financial info, precise location, race/religion, etc.)?

E) AI + RedBlit AI Integration
15) Exactly how RedBlit AI is used (chat, image generation, classification, moderation, recommendations, etc.)
16) What is sent to RedBlit AI (prompts, user content, identifiers, metadata)?
17) Do you use user content to train/fine-tune ANY model (yours or vendor)? Opt-in or opt-out?
18) Do you log prompts/outputs? For how long? Can users delete them?

F) Purposes + Legal Bases (if applicable)
19) Why you collect each category of data (operate service, security, analytics, marketing, personalization)
20) If EU/UK users: do you rely on consent, contract necessity, legitimate interests? (If you don’t know, propose defaults.)

G) Sharing + Third Parties
21) List all vendors/tools: hosting (AWS/GCP), analytics (GA, Mixpanel), crash reporting, email (SendGrid), support (Zendesk), payments (Stripe), ads (Meta/Google), etc.
22) Do you share data with other users publicly (profiles, posts, leaderboards)?
23) Do you sell data? Do you share for “targeted advertising” as defined in some US state laws?

H) Marketing
24) Do you send marketing emails/push notifications? Opt-in/out method?

I) Cookies/Tracking (web)
25) Do you use cookies? Which types (necessary, analytics, ads)? Do you show a cookie banner?

J) Data Retention + Deletion
26) How long you keep each type of data (or desired approach)?
27) Can users delete their account and data? What happens to backups?

K) Security
28) Security measures (encryption in transit/at rest, access controls). If unknown, propose best practice.

L) User Rights
29) Do you want to support access/correction/deletion/portability? How will users request it?

M) Content + Community (if applicable)
30) User generated content? Moderation? Reporting? DMCA/copyright process?

N) Terms of Service / Legal
31) Subscription pricing/refunds/free trials?
32) Acceptable use rules (no illegal content, harassment, malware, scraping)
33) IP ownership: who owns user content? do you need a license to host/process it?
34) AI outputs: disclaimers (not legal/medical advice), accuracy limitations
35) Termination: can you suspend accounts? appeal process?
36) Liability limits, disclaimers, and “as-is” service
37) Dispute resolution preference: governing law (state/country), arbitration vs courts, class action waiver (if you want)
38) Contact method for legal notices

STEP 2 — After I answer, produce these deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Privacy Policy
- Effective date
- Plain-English summary (optional)
- Definitions
- What data we collect (table: category / examples / purpose / sharing / retention)
- How we use data
- How we share data (vendors, legal requests, business transfers)
- AI processing (RedBlit AI) section with clarity on prompts, outputs, training, and retention
- Cookies/analytics section (web)
- Marketing communications
- Data retention
- Security
- Children’s privacy
- International transfers
- User rights (US state privacy rights + EU/UK GDPR if applicable)
- How to contact us
- Updates to the policy

Deliverable 2: Terms of Service
- Effective date
- Eligibility/age
- Account rules
- Subscription/payment/refunds (if applicable)
- Acceptable use + prohibited conduct
- User content license + your IP
- AI features disclaimers (accuracy, no professional advice, output ownership stance)
- Third-party services
- Termination/suspension
- Disclaimers + limitation of liability
- Indemnification
- Dispute resolution + governing law
- Changes to terms
- Contact information

Deliverable 3: Implementation Checklist
- Consent flows (cookie banner, marketing opt-in, AI training opt-in/out)
- In-app settings needed (data download, delete account)
- Vendor DPAs, security basics, log retention
- App store disclosures (Apple/Google “Data Safety” style mapping)

Deliverable 4: Risk Flags for Lawyer Review
- Anything high-risk based on my answers (kids, health, biometrics, ads tracking, arbitration enforceability by jurisdiction, etc.)

Do not claim I will “never get sued.” Use language like “helps reduce risk” and “not legal advice.”
When uncertain, list assumptions and give me options with pros/cons.
Now ask me the questionnaire.
