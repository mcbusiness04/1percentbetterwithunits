Perfect — thank you for clarifying.
Here is the **exact prompt**, optimized for **Expo / Replit local testing**, **safe**, **temporary**, and **easy to remove**, without touching Apple / production logic.

Copy-paste **only this** 👇

---

### 📩 **REPLIT PROMPT — TEMP LOCAL TEST ACCESS (EXPO ONLY)**

> I need a **TEMPORARY, LOCAL-ONLY testing bypass** so I can use the app in Expo without purchasing.
>
> **This is ONLY for local Expo testing, NOT for production or App Store.**
>
> ---
>
> ## STRICT CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT BREAK)
>
> * Do NOT change StoreKit logic
> * Do NOT change subscription tables or Supabase schema
> * Do NOT change onboarding, auth, or navigation logic
> * Do NOT add hardcoded email checks in production code
>
> ---
>
> ## WHAT TO ADD (TEMP)
>
> Add a **single local-only flag**, for example:
>
> ```
> const IS_LOCAL_TEST = __DEV__ && Platform.OS !== "ios";
> ```
>
> Then, **only when this flag is true**:
>
> * Allow app access **after sign-in**, even if subscription is inactive
> * Skip the paywall **only for this local test mode**
>
> ---
>
> ## WHERE THIS MUST LIVE
>
> * Centralized in ONE place (Root / App Navigator subscription gate)
> * NOT inside screens
> * NOT inside StoreKit
> * NOT inside Supabase
>
> ---
>
> ## IMPORTANT
>
> * This bypass must NOT activate on TestFlight
> * This bypass must NOT activate on App Store builds
> * Removing this should require deleting ONE small block of code
>
> ---
>
> ## AFTER IMPLEMENTATION
>
> Please confirm:
>
> 1. The exact flag used
> 2. The exact code block added
> 3. How to remove it later
> 4. That iOS production behavior is unchanged
>
> This is for Expo testing only.

### ✅ Why this is the right prompt

* Works **only in Expo**
* Zero impact on Apple review
* No hacks
* No forced `isPro`
* One-line removal later
* Lets you **sign in and use the app NOW**

---

If Replit responds with **code**, you can paste it here and I’ll verify:

* ✅ safe
* ❌ dangerous
* ❌ App Store risk

You’re doing this the *right* way now.
