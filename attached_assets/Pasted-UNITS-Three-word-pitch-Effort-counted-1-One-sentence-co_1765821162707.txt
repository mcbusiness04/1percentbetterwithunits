UNITS
Three-word pitch: Effort, counted.
1) One-sentence concept + positioning
Units is a zero-friction effort tracker where every tap drops a physical “unit block” into your daily pile—so progress feels tangible, comparable across habits, and impossible to argue with.
Why it wins: it measures effort (inputs) instead of outcomes, keeps users out of shame loops (no streaks), and makes logging viscerally satisfying (block physics + piles + walls) while staying minimal.
2) Target user + core job-to-be-done
Target user: adults who do real work (students, builders, creators, fitness people) and hate streak shame, journaling, or “productivity theater.”
JTBD: “When I’m busy and motivation is unreliable, help me record small honest effort quickly, so I can trust I’m moving forward and see momentum over time.”
3) Addictive loop + retention mechanics
Addictive loop (no dark patterns)
Trigger: “I just did a small piece of effort” OR “I have 10 seconds right now.”
Action (1 tap): tap a habit or task → +1 unit (or quick add multiple).
Reward (instant): a unit block drops into today’s pile with subtle haptics + a satisfying sound toggle; pile height updates immediately; a tiny “Total Units Today” number ticks up.
Investment: soft floors + micro-planning (optional) make tomorrow easier: “Pin today’s 3” + “Habit of the Day” spotlight.
Retention mechanics (no streaks, no punishment)
Soft Floors (weekly): each habit has a minimum healthy pace per week. If under pace, it turns yellow (never red).
Rolling averages: 7/30/90-day averages on the habit detail screen.
Habit of the Day spotlight: automatically highlights one habit that would most benefit from 1–3 units today (computed from soft floor deficit + recent activity). This creates a daily “what should I do?” answer without tasks becoming overwhelming.
Weekly receipt: on Monday morning, show a non-judgmental summary card: “You logged 63 units last week. Avg/day: 9. +12% vs prior week.” (Paid; free gets a tiny in-app banner only.)
Widgets (Paid): Today pile + 1-tap logging from Home Screen.
4) Full feature list (MVP + v1.1) with exact behavior + edge cases
MVP (ship this)
A. Habits
Create habit with:
Habit name (e.g., “Reading”)
Unit name (singular) + unit shorthand (optional, e.g., “page”, “pg”)
Unit size (number + optional measure text, e.g., “1 page”, “0.25 miles”, “5 minutes”)
Soft floor per week (integer units/week; default suggested: 5)
Color (system palette), icon (SF Symbol)
Unit versions (data integrity):
A habit has UnitVersion records.
You can change unit definition only going forward:
“Change unit going forward” creates a new UnitVersion with an effectiveStartDate = today.
Past logs keep referencing the old UnitVersion.
The UI always shows the current unit for input and “Lifetime units” counts are still raw units (not converted).
Edge cases:
If user changes unit and today already has logs: new logs reference new UnitVersion; the habit detail shows a small label: “Unit changed on Dec 15, 2025.”
If user sets soft floor to 0: soft floor indicator hides entirely.
B. Logging (the core)
Home screen list of habits:
Tap habit row → +1 unit instantly
Long-press habit row → Quick Add:
A bottom sheet with:
big “+” and “–”
keypad toggle (1–99)
“Add” button
Undo: after adding units, show a 5-second toast:
“Added 1 unit • Undo”
Undo reverses exactly that action (including multi-add).
Edge cases:
If user adds 0 units in Quick Add → disable Add button.
If user tries to add >999 at once → cap at 999 and show “Max 999 per add.”
C. The “piles” + “walls” visualization (fun, signature)
Today Pile (Home):
The top of Home shows a pile container (like a tray).
Each logged unit spawns a small rectangular block that drops in with simple physics.
Blocks stack; pile height is the “reward.”
A small counter: “Total Units Today: 12”
Habit Wall (Habit detail):
A “wall” grid: columns = days, rows = unit blocks.
Default shows last 14 days (scroll horizontally for more in Paid).
Each day column stacks unit blocks (no streak highlighting).
Weekly separators shown as subtle vertical lines.
Edge cases:
Very high unit days: after 50 blocks in a single day column, compress into “block bundles” (each visual block represents 5 units) and show “×5” on that block. Raw counts remain accurate.
D. Tasks (minimal, not a full to-do app)
A Today Tasks section on Home (below habits):
Add task: title + optional habit link + unit estimate (1–5) default 1.
Completing a task drops estimated units into today’s pile (counts toward Total Units Today) AND optionally into linked habit (see rule below).
Rule (to keep thesis clean):
Tasks are just containers for effort.
If a task is linked to a habit, completing it logs units to that habit.
If not linked, it logs to “General Effort” (a built-in, hidden habit that is not shown in the main habit list unless toggled on in Settings).
Edge cases:
If a linked habit is deleted/archived, task becomes unlinked and logs to General Effort.
E. Stats (simple receipts)
A Stats tab with:
Total Units Today
Units this week
Lifetime units
Rolling averages (7/30/90)
Top habits this week (by units)
F. Local-first storage (no account)
All data stored on device.
Optional iCloud backup toggle is Paid v1.1.
v1.1 (after MVP is stable)
Share stat cards (static images): “8,214 reading units” / “Avg 17 units/day in 2025”
Widgets: 1-tap log for top 3 habits; Today Units counter
Reminders: soft floor nudge + single daily “drop 1 unit?” reminder (opt-in)
Seasons (lightweight): label date ranges (“Exam prep”) and filter stats by season
Export: CSV export of logs
iCloud sync (no login; uses user’s iCloud)
No streaks, no social feed, no “levels.”

Downgrade handling:
If subscription expires, keep all data but:
Lock to 2 habits (user chooses which to keep active; others auto-archived)
History beyond 7 days becomes view-only blurred
Units/day cap re-applies (new logs blocked when over)
8) App Store / iOS compliance checklist
Apple Sign-In requirement
Not required in MVP because there is no account creation.
If later adding accounts (non-iCloud), then:
If you offer any third-party login, you must offer Sign in with Apple.
Privacy + data disclosure
Collect minimum:
Habit names, unit definitions, log counts, task titles (all stored locally).
If analytics enabled:
Use privacy-friendly analytics; avoid user-identifying data.
Provide:
Privacy Policy URL (required for subscriptions)
Disclose any tracking; if none, ensure SDKs don’t track.
Subscription rules
Paywall must include:
Price, billing period
Auto-renewal statement
Restore Purchases
Links to Terms + Privacy
Include “Manage Subscription” link in Settings.
ATT (tracking)
Do not show ATT unless you actually track users across apps/sites.
Avoid ad SDKs in MVP.
User-generated content safeguards
None (no feed, no public sharing inside app). Share cards are exported images only.
Permissions + justification strings
Notifications (optional, v1.1):
NSUserNotificationUsageDescription: “Get reminders for your soft floors and daily units.”
Photos (only if saving share cards):
Use system share sheet; avoid Photo Library permission by exporting via share sheet.
No HealthKit, no Contacts, no Location.
9) Technical spec (builder-friendly)
Storage
Local-first: SQLite/Core Data (or equivalent local DB).
Cloud:
v1.1 Pro: iCloud/CloudKit for sync (no login UI).

Business logic rules
Counts:
Today units = sum(LogEntry.unitsAdded where dayKey=today)
Habit today/week/lifetime similarly filtered
Soft floor status (weekly):
weekKey = ISO week in local timezone
Under pace if habitWeekUnits < softFloor
Habit of the Day selection:
For each non-archived habit with softFloor>0:
deficit = max(0, softFloor - thisWeekUnits)
score = deficit * 2 + (unitsLast7Days == 0 ? 3 : 0)
Pick highest score; if all zero, pick most recently logged habit.
IAP (StoreKit 2)
Products:
units_pro_monthly
units_pro_yearly (trial optional)
Implement:
Purchase
Restore
Entitlement caching
Paywall limit checks
Push notifications plan (v1.1)
Opt-in timing:
After user logs 10 total units (they “get it”).
Templates:
Daily (optional): “Drop 1 unit into today’s pile?”
Soft floor (weekly, Sat morning): “You’re {x} units from your Reading soft floor.”
Analytics events (privacy-safe)
app_opened
habit_created {unit_type, soft_floor}
unit_logged {habit_id, units_added, method}
task_created {estimated_units, linked}
task_completed {estimated_units, linked}
paywall_viewed {trigger}
purchase_started {product}
purchase_success {product}
purchase_restore {result}
limit_hit {limit_type}
Error handling + offline
Offline: fully functional (local DB).
If purchase verification fails: show “Couldn’t verify purchase. Try again.” + restore option.
If DB write fails: show top banner + log to console.
10) Security + privacy by design
Store everything locally; no account = minimal risk.
If iCloud sync added, rely on Apple’s encryption + CloudKit.
Provide Erase All Data:
Requires typing “ERASE”
Deletes all local DB records and resets settings.
If analytics enabled, do not store habit names; only IDs or categories.
11) QA test plan (critical cases)
App Store rejection prevention
Paywall includes required subscription terms, restore, links
Restore purchases works without login
Manage subscription link opens correctly
No misleading trial language
Limits are enforced without trapping user
Crash + logic tests
Add habit with empty fields → Create disabled
Rapid tapping habit 50 times → no freeze; counts correct
Quick Add 999 units → capped; UI still responsive
Undo after multi-add → reverts exact amount
Change unit version mid-day → old logs remain old version; new logs use new version
Archive habit linked to tasks → tasks log to General Effort
Free limits:
attempt 3rd habit → paywall
exceed 20 units/day → paywall; no logging beyond cap
wall scroll beyond 7 days → blur + paywall
Purchase flow:
successful purchase unlocks instantly
cancel purchase leaves app unchanged
restore on fresh install works
Dynamic Type max size → all buttons reachable, no clipped text
VoiceOver reads habit rows and quick add controls correctly
Timezone change → dayKey recalculation does not corrupt old days (dayKey stored at log time)
12) Build Instructions for the AI App Builder (step-by-step)
Create an iOS app named “Units” using SwiftUI (or builder equivalent) with a Tab Bar: Today / Stats / Settings.
Implement local database with the exact schemas listed (Habit, UnitVersion, LogEntry, Task, AppSettings, Entitlements).
Build Today screen:
Top “Today Pile” physics animation container.
Habit list rows with tap-to-log (+1) and long-press Quick Add sheet.
Tasks section with create/complete behavior.
Undo toast (5 seconds).
Build Habit creation modal with validation and soft floor controls; create initial UnitVersion with effectiveStartDate = creation date.
Build Logging engine:
Create LogEntry on tap/quick add/task completion.
Update pile animation with correct number of blocks (bundle visuals after 50/day).
Build Habit Detail screen:
Stats chips (today/week/lifetime/avg7d).
Wall visualization (14-day default, horizontal scroll).
Day tap → popover with remove/day edit actions.
Build Stats tab using aggregated queries from LogEntry grouped by dayKey/weekKey; apply Free vs Pro feature gating (blur locked sections).
Build Settings tab with toggles, legal links, restore, manage subscription, erase all data.
Implement StoreKit 2 subscriptions:
Products: monthly + yearly (trial optional).
Entitlement check on app launch and after purchase.
Restore purchases button.
Paywall screen with required copy + links.
Enforce Free limits exactly:
2 habits max
20 total units/day cap
7-day wall history
3 tasks max
Stats: only 7-day average
Add Accessibility:
VoiceOver labels as specified
Dynamic Type scaling and layout resilience
Haptic/sound toggles respected
Add polish:
Subtle haptics on drop
Optional sound toggle
Fast launch; avoid heavy animations on list scroll
Consistent spacing and typography (system font, SF Symbols)
Add App Store readiness:
Privacy Policy + Terms placeholders
Subscription disclosures + restore
No unnecessary permissions in Info.plist
Run QA checklist items; fix edge cases; ensure no streak UI exists anywhere.
