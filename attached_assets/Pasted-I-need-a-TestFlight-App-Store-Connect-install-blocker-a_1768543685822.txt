I need a TestFlight / App Store Connect install-blocker audit.

My app uploads successfully to App Store Connect, shows “Ready to Test” in TestFlight, but fails to install on iPhone with:
“The requested app is not available or doesn’t exist.”

Please do NOT change any code yet.

Instead, OUTPUT a clear report with the following EXACT sections:

1. APP IDENTITY
- iOS bundle identifier actually used at build time
- CFBundleIdentifier
- CFBundleVersion (build number)
- CFBundleShortVersionString (app version)
- App display name
- Any recent changes to bundle ID, app name, or slug

2. EXPO / EAS CONFIG
- app.json / app.config.js values related to:
  - ios.bundleIdentifier
  - name
  - slug
  - owner
- eas.json build profiles used (development / preview / production)
- Which profile is used for TestFlight
- appVersionSource (remote vs local)

3. APP STORE CONNECT–CRITICAL FLAGS
- Whether this build is marked as:
  - Internal testing eligible
  - Uses encryption (ATS / export compliance)
  - Requires test information
- Any required App Store Connect metadata that is missing but NOT shown as an error

4. TESTFLIGHT INSTALL BLOCKERS
Check for and report if ANY of the following exist:
- Mismatch between bundleIdentifier and App Store Connect app record
- App renamed after initial upload
- Multiple app records using similar bundle IDs
- Build uploaded under the wrong App Store Connect app
- Unsupported device or iOS deployment target
- Entitlements mismatch
- Invalid provisioning profile for TestFlight
- build not associated with an internal tester group

5. SIGNING & PROVISIONING
- Team ID used
- Provisioning profile type (App Store / Ad Hoc / Development)
- Whether this profile is valid for TestFlight installs
- Whether a new profile was generated recently

6. SUMMARY
- A short list of ANY findings that could cause TestFlight to show the app but refuse installation
- Explicitly state if NOTHING in code/config would block TestFlight install

Important:
- Do NOT say “everything looks fine” unless you verify every section.
- Do NOT fix anything yet.
- This output is for manual review.
